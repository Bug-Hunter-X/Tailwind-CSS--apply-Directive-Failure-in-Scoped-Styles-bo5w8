# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Failure in Scoped Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within scoped styles (e.g., `<style scoped>` in Vue or similar).  The problem arises when the necessary `@tailwind` directives are missing from your main CSS file, leading to the `@apply` directive being ignored or causing unexpected styling.

## Problem

The `@apply` directive relies on the base Tailwind directives to resolve the utility classes.  If these directives (generated using `npx tailwindcss init` or similar) are absent, `@apply` will not function properly, resulting in the styles not being applied.

## Solution

Ensure you have the `@tailwind` directives included in your main CSS file. This usually involves running the Tailwind CLI commands to generate or update your CSS file, including the correct base and components/layers you need in the `@tailwind` directives. In the main CSS file, these should be added to handle the different screen sizes (base, components, etc.).
