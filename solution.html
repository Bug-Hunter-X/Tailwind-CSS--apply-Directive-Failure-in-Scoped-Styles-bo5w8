To fix this, make sure your main CSS file (usually `styles.css` or similar) contains the necessary `@tailwind` directives to process `@apply`.  These directives are usually generated automatically when setting up Tailwind CSS. For example using `tailwindcss init` and adding required directives for base, components, utilities, etc.

**Example (Solution):**

```css
/* styles.css or similar */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* ... your custom styles ... */
```

After adding or correctly configuring `@tailwind` directives and rebuilding your application, the `@apply` directive should function as expected. If you are using a framework like Next.js, ensure that your CSS is properly imported and configured to work with your setup and Tailwind plugin.
